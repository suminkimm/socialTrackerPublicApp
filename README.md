# socialTrackerPublicApp
This code sample builds the backend API and the frontend for a React Native app that allows a user to track the amount of time he or she spends within various social circles. During this past coronavirus season, I was having trouble staying in touch with certain friends and was inspired to create an app that manages one's social time. The app allows the user to:
1) Create new friend profiles and social circles (ex: Family, Classmates, Coworkers, etc.)
2) Track past meetings the user had with his or her friends
3) View an overall summary of his or her meetings for the month, such as which social circle and people he/she met with the most
